Net::Chat::Daemon version 0.2
=============================

Module for setting up a daemon that can be controlled via instant
messaging. Useful for automation frameworks that you want to be able
to monitor and control easily.

Note that this module is currently very preliminary. It contains no
tests -- mostly because I don't want to write a mock server, nor do I
want to flood jabber.org with test messages and new accounts. (I have
asked permission, to see if they even care, but I have received no
response as yet.) Perhaps I will eventually write a mock server, but
for now I'm just going to release this module so I can build on it.

I have documented the code and internals, but I have very little in
the way of friendly usage documents yet.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Net::Jabber
  Time::HiRes

You will also need a jabber id. I use jabber.org as my server; if you
pass in 'somename@jabber.org' as the user to these modules, they will
automatically try to register a new account for you (with the default
password of "secret"). Use your own username and password if you have
one; otherwise just make something up. (Actually, you'll want at least
two accounts: one to put in your IM client, and another for the
daemon. The two of you will chat with each other.)

You do not need to use jabber.org. You can use another of the free
servers, or run your own jabber server. I am currently using jabberd2
(http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/).
